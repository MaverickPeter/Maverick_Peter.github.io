> To be a better man.

Hi, I am *@maverickp* (Xuecheng Xu), a PhD major in Robotics. I am currently working on embodied intelligence. My PhD thesis is about multi-agent SLAM systems.

I hold a Ph.D. from the Control Science and Engineering College at Zhejiang University and currently serve as the Chief Technical Assistant at the Zhejiang Humanoid Robotics Innovation Center. My responsibilities include planning the company's technical roadmap, and managing the technical team and projects, as well as conducting research on core algorithms and developing frameworks.

During my doctoral studies at Zhejiang University's [Robotics Lab](https://space.bilibili.com/544651460?spm_id_from=333.788.b_765f7570696e666f.1), I focused on multi-robot systems and various issues in global positioning. In my first year of graduate school, I worked with my senior colleague to develop a [mapping](https://github.com/ZJU-Robotics-Lab/GEM) system, which we published in two papers, open-sourced the code, and applied it in several projects. Following this collaboration, I delved into multi-agent localization and mapping, considering the premise of sensor heterogeneity in multi-agent systems. Building upon our previous mapping work, I further developed the Differentiable Phase Correlation Network (DPCN) [algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09474) for heterogeneous localization. One of the ideas from this work led to a journal publication on location reidentification: [DiSCO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359460). In my third year, I continued working on DiSCO, developing a pose-estimating place recognition method in collaboration with my junior colleague, which resulted in publications of [RING](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07992) and [RING++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05984). Due to the need for physical experiments and project requirements, I also developed a centralized real-time multi-robot SLAM system called [MR_SLAM](https://github.com/MaverickPeter/MR_SLAM), which has been successfully implemented in a project and concluded. In the later stages of my Ph.D., I worked at Alibaba DAMO Academy to develop a panoramic visual global localization system named [vDiSCO](https://github.com/MaverickPeter/vDiSCO). During the final stages of writing my dissertation, I was involved in preparing various affairs for the establishment of the Zhejiang Humanoid Robotics Innovation Center.
